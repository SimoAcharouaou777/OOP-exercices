# Problem: Content Management System with User Roles and Permissions
# Task:
# Create a simple content management system where users can create, edit, and delete articles. The system should have different user roles (Admin, Editor, and Viewer) with specific permissions:

# Admin: Can create, edit, delete any article and manage users.
# Editor: Can create, edit, and delete their own articles.
# Viewer: Can only view articles.
# Requirements:

# Create a User class with properties like username, password, role, and methods to check permissions.
# Create an Article class with properties like title, content, author, and methods to manage articles.
# Create a CMS class to handle user authentication, article management, and role-based access control.
