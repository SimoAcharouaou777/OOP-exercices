# Exercise 4: Static Methods and Singleton Pattern
# Objective: Practice using static methods and implementing the Singleton pattern.
# Instructions:
# Create a Database class that implements the Singleton pattern.
# Define a private static property instance and a private constructor.
# Define a static method getInstance that returns the single instance of the Database class.
# Prevent the cloning and unserializing of the instance.
# Test the Singleton pattern by trying to create multiple instances and verifying they are the same.
