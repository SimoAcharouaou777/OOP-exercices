# Exercise 3: Constructor Overloading Using Default Values
# Objective: Practice creating constructors with default parameter values.
# Instructions:
# Create a Book class with properties title, author, and year.
# Define a constructor that initializes these properties, with author defaulting to "Unknown" and year defaulting to the current year.
# Instantiate the Book class with different numbers of arguments to test the constructor overloading
